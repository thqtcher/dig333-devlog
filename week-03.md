### Platt 6: Very Simple Switching

#### Outcomes

- I learned how to check the continuity using a switch and a multimeter. The continuity test looks like a diode and "sound alert".

This table shows some of the different types of switches covered in this chapter:

Abbr. | Name | ON/OFF | Example
--- | --- | --- | ---
SPST (1P1T) | single-pole, single-throw switch | on-off | Light switches in your house. Only connect circuit in one direction.
DPST (2P1T) | double-pole, single-throw switch | on-off | To control a 240-volt appliance in your house
SPDT (1P2T) | single-pole, double-throw switch | on-on | A basic on/off toggle switch
DPDT (2P2T) | double-pole, double-throw switch | on-on | Toggle switch with two poles, often used in AC power or to control a DC motor
SPST (1P1T) | single-pole, single-throw pushbutton | off-(on) | A  "momentary" switch that is on only when held down, and flips back to off when released.

- **toggle**: the part of a switch that you flip with your finger
- **pole**: center terminal of a double-through (DT) switch
- **sparking**: when you make or break electrical contact

#### Questions
- Do you know where the term "audio jack" comes from? The inventor of the first electrical switch called it a "jack knife". The ubiquitous "jack switch" was used for many years in telephone operators, until it was replaced by relays (electrically operated switches) and finally, transistors.
