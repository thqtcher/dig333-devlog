This week I was able to implement a way to represent the parking lot in the form of a json object. The json file that is produced is updated everytime there is a change in if a parking spot is being occupied. On top of this, I was able to succesfully get the mobile app I am working on to display this information accordingly. Because I was working on the app I am not sure if producing the json file will work for my raspberry pi because I did all the work on my laptop. So the next steps for my project include: figuring out if producing the json file works on my raspberry pi, somehow coming up with a way to send that json file to my laptop remotely so my app can update this information properly, and working on the final design and UI of my mobile app. I'm still working out the best way to make my project unuseful... And so far it's unuseful in the sense that it doesn't work at night, different amount of light and shadows affect output, and I can make it so the way the output is represented is confusing. I was wondering what else I could add to make my project more unuseful? I also was wondering if people had suggestions for the design of my app?
