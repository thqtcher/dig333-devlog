## Week 8 MILESTONE 1

### 

Setup webcam with raspberry pi that displayed live footage in seaparte window. This required setting up, installing, and learning the basics of openCV. Based on further research for how I should move forward with my project I found a machine learning python library called tensorFlow that can be used for object detection. My next issue is where I should setup my camera to get a good birds eye angle on an active parking lot. Some other things that need to be addressed potentially are how to power my device remotely (pretty sure the reaspberry pi zero only works when plugged into computer), and how I can make the webcam work at night.
