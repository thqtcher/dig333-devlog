## Week 2

### Sanjay Sarma, The Internet of Things

- Summary: In the Internet of Things Sanjay details his work in MIT in developing RFIDs and their importance in devices people connect to. The article talks about how a couple decades ago Sanjay was excited for what the technological world in the future. He now has become growingly concerned with the security implementations of many of the devices people connect to today. Sanjay then highlights 3 procedures that should be a focus when implementing devices we connect to in the future
- Quote: "To leverage the power of the IoT responsibly and profitably, you need to develop and implement your own IoT technologies, solutions, and applications." This quote details one of Sanjay's concerns in how individuals should be develop their own methods of preventing security issues.
- Comment: While this article approaches the world of growing technology negatively, I believe if future devices are developed correctly they have a possibility of having beneficial lasting affects on us as humans.
- Question: Where does one draw the line on devices that encroach on our day to day lives?

## Week 3

### Julian Oliver, The Critical Engineering Manifesto

- Summary: This article goes over the basic frameworks of what it takes to become a successful critical engineer. It primarily focuses on the importance of the engineer prioritizing the user's experience when developing new technologies. It also indicates engineering as one of the most important aspects of society today. This is because it shapes the way we move communicate and think.
- Quote: "The Critical Engineer considers the exploit to be the most desirable form of exposure." I was confused with what this really meant which is why I chose to select this quote
- Comment: The way a critical engineer is supposed to think according to this manifesto sounds very similar to how one should approach testing the usability of a website.
- Question: How does one incorporate their own individuality without disrupting the user's experience with their technology?

## Week 4

### Philip K. Dick, Pay for the Printer

- Summary: This story takes place in the future where an alien species called Bitlongs has replaced the human race. The Bitlongs seem to have the ability to replicate or reproduce any item they are given. The main conflict of this story is that Bitlongs are starting to become old extinct and the humans are forced to relearn how to build. 
- Quote: "Printing means merely copying. I can't explain to you what building is; you'll have to try it yourself to find out. Building and printing are two totally different things."
- Comment: The story seemed to critique how reliant humans will be on technology in the future.
- Question: In what ways does this fictional story from 1956 reflect our reality?
## Week 5

## Week 6

### Mayo Nissen, Unseen Sensors: Constantly Sensing but Rarely Seen

- Summary: This article has more of an optimistic approach to the world's up and coming techonological world. Instead of pointing out a lot of the negatives of technological advancements the article defends large tech companies by arguing that these companies make decisions that will benefit the general population. This article mainly talks about the large amount of sensors that go unnoticed by many specifically sensors used in public on streets or for traffic.
- Quote: "They are invisible by default. Housed in anonymous plastic or metal boxes, these sensors rarely give away even a hint as to their purpose, intention, or ownership."
- Comment: I liked that this article had a more positive approach to sensors and argued that companies make decisions to implement things to benefit the general population.
- Question: Should private companies own the data that is created in this most public of contexts?

## Experiments

### Taste the power

1. -can't figure out photos
2. Multimeter acts as the eyes and ears for electrical currents
3. Quiz question: Give a step by step explanation as to how to test voltage

### Abuse a battery

1. Notes: A water analogy can be used to explain the elements of ohm's law. If you imagine a pipe that pushes water the act of pushing water through that pipe is voltage, and if you are pushing water around somewhere that can represent the current, and if that water travels through a smaller pipe that can represent resistance. The unit for voltage is volt(s), the unit for current is ampere(s), and the unit for resistance is ohm(s). AC is used for traveling longer distances like cities whereas DC can't go as far.  
2. It is more important to understand the elements of Ohm's law than the actual calculation.
3. Quiz question: What unit is used to measure current?

### Your first circuit


1. Notes: It is easier to identify a resistors resistance with a multimeter. On a circuit the voltage of a battery doesn't accumulate or add up (if you have two separate sources of power they won't add up unless you combine them)
2. Different LEDs require a different amount of power to light up. This also means different LEDs have different thresholds for how much voltage they can receive
3. Quiz question: What does each colored line represent on a resistor?
